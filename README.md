Deploying the quickstarts
-----------

### Deploying locally

Change to the directory of the quickstart that you want to deploy.

Start the JBoss container. To do this, run

	$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh

or if you are using windows

	$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.bat

To deploy the application, you first need to produce the archive to deploy using the following Maven goal:

	mvn package

You can now deploy the artifact by executing the following command:

	mvn jboss-as:deploy

This will deploy both the client and service applications.

The application will be running at the following URL http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/.

To undeploy run this command:

	mvn jboss-as:undeploy
